# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
`main.go` is the entry point for the Go web server. Core domains live in top-level packages such as `field/`, `game/`, `network/`, `partner/`, `playoff/`, `tournament/`, and `websocket/`. Web UI assets are in `web/`, `static/`, and `templates/`. Pre-generated schedules are in `schedules/`. BoltDB data is stored in `db/` (and test fixtures in `*_test.db` files at the repo root).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
See `go.mod` for what version of Go to use.
1. `make`
   Builds the `r7-arena` binary in the r7-arena folder.
2. `./r7-arena/r7-arena`
   Runs the server; open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.
3. `go test ./...`
   Runs all Go tests across packages. Should be run after making any code changes to ensure nothing is broken.
4. `go fmt ./...`
   Formats all Go code in the repo. Should be run after making any code changes to ensure consistent style.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow standard Go style: tabs for indentation, exported names in `CamelCase`, unexported in `camelCase`. Format code with `gofmt` before submitting changes. If you update a set of enum-style constants, run `go generate ./...` to refresh the generated enum string helpers. Keep package names short and domain-focused (matching existing directories like `field`, `game`, `partner`).

Order imports alphabetically without any grouping or empty lines between them or special treatment of standard library vs third-party imports. Update any files that don't adhere to this standard if editing them for other reasons. Don't use goimports.

## Testing Guidelines
Tests are Go `*_test.go` files co-located with packages (for example `field/`, `game/`, `partner/`, `playoff/`). Use `go test ./...` for the full suite and `go test ./field -run TestName` to target specific areas. When adding new behavior, add or update tests in the same package and prefer table-driven tests for coverage.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit messages in this repo are short, imperative sentences (for example “Fix driver station TCP reads”) and often include an issue/PR number in parentheses (for example “... (#258)”). Keep to that style.

PRs should include:
1. A clear summary of the change.
2. Test notes (exact commands run, for example `go test ./...`).
3. UI screenshots when changing pages in `web/`, `static/`, or `templates/`.

## Configuration & Ops Notes
Cheesy Arena is designed to run as a local web server and uses BoltDB for data. For field networking and hardware integrations, see the project README and relevant `field/` or `plc/` code before making behavioral changes.

## Upstream Porting Workflow
This repo is the generic-only lite fork. When asked to check the full Cheesy Arena repo for portable changes, use the sibling local checkout at `../cheesy-arena` as the source of truth. Do not fetch from GitHub unless explicitly asked.

Track the last reviewed upstream commit in `UPSTREAM.md`, not in this file. To inspect candidate changes, compare that checkpoint against the sibling repo:

1. `git -C ../cheesy-arena log --oneline <last-reviewed>..HEAD`
2. `git -C ../cheesy-arena diff --stat <last-reviewed>..HEAD`
3. Inspect promising commits or paths with `git -C ../cheesy-arena show <commit>` or path-limited diffs.

Port only game-agnostic changes. Preserve this repo's module path, repository identity, remotes, and generic-only behavior. Do not reintroduce game-mode branching, year-specific scoring, LED/game-specific hardware hooks, TBA publishing flows, or removed generic-vs-game scaffolding such as `GameMode`, `ScoreGeneric`, `RankingFieldsGeneric`, or `IsGenericMode`.

After a porting pass, run the relevant tests and update `UPSTREAM.md` to the newest upstream commit that was actually reviewed.
